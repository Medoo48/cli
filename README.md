A simple command line tool for creating and interacting with your leaf projects. You can do stuff like installing packages, interacting with your app, previewing your app, ...

## Installation

You can get this tool up and running on your system using composer:

```bash
composer global require leafs/cli
```

Make sure to place Composer's system-wide vendor bin directory in your `$PATH` so the leaf executable can be located by your system. This directory exists in different locations based on your operating system; however, some common locations include:

- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin`
- macOS: `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin`
- GNU / Linux Distributions: `$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin` or `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin`

You could also find the composer's global installation path by running `composer global about` and looking up from the first line.

Eg (Adding composer bin to path linux):

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin
```

Eg (Adding composer bin to path mac):

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin
echo $PATH
```

## Usage Guide

### Creating projects

To start a new project, simply open up your console or terminal in your directory
for projects and enter:

With leaf 3:

```sh
leaf create <project-name> --v3
```

With leaf 2:

```sh
leaf create <project-name> --v2
```

If no version is passed in, leaf CLI will prompt you to select a version to use in your leaf app.

```bash
leaf create <project-name>
```

```sh
* Select a version to use 
  [0] v3
  [1] v2
 >
```

This will now prompt you to select a preset

```sh
Creating a new Leaf app "<project-name>" in ./projects-directory.

* Please pick a preset 
  [0] leaf
  [1] leaf mvc
  [2] leaf api
  [3] skeleton
 > 
```

Selecting a number will generate a leaf app based on the associated preset. As you can see, there are 4 presets:

- **Leaf**: a bare leaf project
- **Leaf MVC**: a leaf MVC project with leaf 2
- **Leaf API**: a leaf API project with leaf 2
- **Skeleton**: a leaf skeleton project

You can also pick a preset directly without going through the interactive installer.

**Leaf:**

```bash
leaf create <project-name> --basic
```

**Leaf API:**

```bash
leaf create <project-name> --api
```

**Leaf MVC:**

```bash
leaf create <project-name> --mvc
```

**Leaf Skeleton:**

```bash
leaf create <project-name> --skeleton
```

### Installing packages

This cli tool also adds a feature to install modules from composer

```sh
leaf install ui
```

This installs the `leafs/ui` package.

You can also install third party packages from packagist

```sh
leaf install psr/log
```

### Interactive Shell

You can also use the interactive shell to interact with your app.

```bash
$ leaf interact
...
>>> $user = new User;
...
>>> $user->name = "Mychi";
...
>>> $user->save();
```

### Previewing your app

This opens up your app on the PHP local server.

```sh
leaf serve
```

You can also specify the port

```bash
leaf serve -p 8000
```

In v2.1, you can also start the leaf server with hot module watching. This reloads your application anytime a change is made to your application code. To get started, simply start the leaf server with the `--watch` flag.

```sh
leaf serve --port 8000 --watch
```
